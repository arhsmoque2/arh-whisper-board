/**
 * Making a picture acceptable to the app it is being inserted into (issue #280).
 *
 * Apps declare which content types they will take, and the declarations are narrower than reality:
 * a WhatsApp sticker is a WebP, and a chat box that happily takes `image/gif` may not list
 * `image/webp` at all. Rather than give up at that point, the file is converted once into a type the
 * editor did name — which for a still image is lossless and unnoticeable.
 *
 * An animated image is the one case where that is not honest: flattening it to PNG would silently
 * turn a moving sticker into a frozen one, which is worse than saying it did not work. So animation
 * is detected from the file header and those keep their own type or go to the clipboard.
