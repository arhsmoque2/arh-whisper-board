/**
 * Re-encodes a WebP into one WhatsApp will accept as a sticker (issue #280).
 *
 * Measured on a real device: a sticker of exactly 512×512 within WhatsApp's size budget goes straight
 * into the chat. One that misses those bounds is taken by WhatsApp and then refused by its own
 * validator — an empty sticker frame appears and "Couldn't share" follows. Since stickers received in
 * WhatsApp are routinely 256×256 or 950 KB, most of a collection is on the wrong side of that line,
 * and the only way across is to re-encode.
 *
 * This applies to **still** stickers just as much as to animated ones, which the first version of this
 * class got wrong: it re-encoded animations and let stills through untouched, so an ordinary 256×256
 * sticker was offered under WhatsApp's own type and bounced with the same empty frame. The rule now
 * has no exceptions — nothing is offered as a sticker that is not shaped like one.
 *
 * There is no animated-WebP encoder on Android, but there does not need to be: the platform can encode
 * single frames, and [WebPContainer] can write the file around them. So an animation is decoded frame
 * by frame, each one composed onto the canvas as the format prescribes and scaled, and then quality is
 * lowered — and, if that is not enough, frames are dropped — until it fits.
 *
 * Transparency survives all of it, which is the reason this route was chosen over the two obvious
 * alternatives: a looping MP4 has no alpha channel at all, and GIF has only a single transparent
 * colour, which turns every soft edge into a jagged one.
