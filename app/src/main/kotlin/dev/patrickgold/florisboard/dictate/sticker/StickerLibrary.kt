 * can be written to a JSON file and read back on the next keyboard start without touching the Storage
 * Access Framework at all. The actual [android.net.Uri] is rebuilt on demand from [StickerIndex.treeUri]
 * plus [StickerItem.docId], which is also what makes a stale index harmless: a document that has since
 * been deleted simply fails to load its thumbnail instead of corrupting anything.
