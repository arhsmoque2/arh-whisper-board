/**
 * Puts images into the sticker folder and takes them out again (issue #280).
 *
 * The folder belongs to the user, not to this app, so everything here goes through the Storage Access
 * Framework on the tree they picked. That has one consequence worth stating plainly: a folder granted
 * before this existed carries read permission only, and adding or deleting needs it picked once more.
 * [canWrite] is what the UI asks before offering either.
 *
 * Where the images come from is deliberately not this class's business. The share sheet hands over
 * `content://` URIs from WhatsApp, Telegram or a gallery; the file picker hands over the same kind of
 * thing. Both end up here as a list of URIs to copy.
